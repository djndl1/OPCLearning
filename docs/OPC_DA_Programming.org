#+TITLE: OPC DA Programming

* Overview

The Custom Interface Objects include mainly two objects

- =OPCServer=

- =OPCGroup=

If therror result is any FAILED error, the OPC server should return =NULL= for all =out= pointer (Standard COM behavior). =NULL= pointer cannot be passed in due to COM marshalling restrictions. =NULL= in-argument is ignored. =size_is(,dwCount)= indicated an actual array of the indicated type, instead of a pointer to an array of pointers.
